This repo consists of part of codes that I wrote as a PhD student in applied math at Northwestern University. 
- cuda_solving_pde consists of C implementation of solving heat equation using Cuda programming 
- data_assimilation consists of implementation of using particle filtering for hurricane intensity forecasting
- Disease modeling consists of implementation convergent cross mapping, a dynamical systems & time series method to infer causality between two variables
- sea_ice consists of codes used to generate results in the paper: Noise-induced tipping under periodic forcing: preferred tipping phase in a non-adiabatic forcing regime
